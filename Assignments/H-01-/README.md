Abstraction
- The act of hiding the more complex details in a program. Preferably through a class.

Attributes / Properties
- Attributes denote a part of an aggregate object, while Properties cover the characteristics of a class.

Class
- The foundation of objects that contain the primary values and implementations of
behaviour. Keyword <Class>

Class Variable
- Variables that are declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists regardless of the
number of instances that exist within the class.

Composition
- Description of a class that references one or more objects from other classes in instance variables.

Encapsulation
- The act of binding a couple of data, concepts and functions into a singular unit. 

Friends
- A function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data. Keyword <Friend>

Inheritance
- When a Child Class inherits functions and variables from a Parent Class. Mostly done through a virtual function.
Keyword <Virtual>

Instance Variable
- Variables defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.

Member Variable
- A variable that is associated with a specific object, which can be accessed by all of it's methods.

Method
- The behavior of the objects created in the class.

Multiple Inheritance
- Objects inheriting from more than one Parent object/class.

Object
- A customized variable that is created through a class. 

Overloading
- Calling a function with the same name, but different parameters.
i.e Calling int add(int, int), and int add(double, double)

Polymorphism
- The ability to process objects differently depending on the data type or class.

Public
- Functions/Variables that can be accessed by anyone.
Private
- Functions/Variables that can only be accessed through Public Functions.
Protected
- Functions/Variables that can only be accessed by the original class and Friends.

Virtual
- Function or method whose behavior can be overridden within an inherited class by a function 
with the same signature. Keyword <Virtual>
